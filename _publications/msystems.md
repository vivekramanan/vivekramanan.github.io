title: "Augmenting bacterial similarity measures using a graph-based genome representation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024
excerpt: 'Genome relationships amongst bacteria are commonly performed using 16S rRNA comparisons or whole genome comparisons. A motivation of interest in this common protocol was how to consider orthologous sections of the genomes that may have moved around in dynamic circular bacterial genomes.This method is an exploration of taking functional regions of genomes and using them to calculate a distance metric, using a linear genome representation and a geometric distance measure instead of a nucleotide based measure.'
