title: "Clustered 8-Oxo-Guanine Mutations and Oncogenic Gene Fusions in Microsatellite-Unstable Colorectal Cancer"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021
excerpt: 'MSI-H colorectal cancer cases are often characterized by oncogenic fusions in driver genes. Junction sequences of these fusions (50 base pair combinations surrounding the breakpoint) revealed a particular type of mutation, known as 8-oxo-guanine mutations, that are linked to environmental causes and potentially to the microbial metabolite, butyrate, which can modulate oxidative damage.'
