Hiya there - I'm Vivek and I'm currently a third-year PhD candidate in Computational Biology at Brown University. I work in the [Center of Computational Molecular Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/) (CCMB) and the [Brown Center of Biomedical Informatics](https://bcbi.brown.edu/) (BCBI). 

I'm advised by [Indra Neil Sarkar](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/isarkar) and from a birds-eye view, work on the interesection between health, biological molecular data, and computer science techniques. 

Some of the topics I work on
======

**Microbiome**
I've been interested in the microbiome since my undergraduate education. Currently, some of my interests are: how microbiomes develop in infant guts, perturbations that impact composition and diversity, how diets across different groups of humans / animal groups affect composition, microbial metabolism and gut epithelia, horizontal transfer within microbiomes, and long-term evolution of microbiomes across human lifespans. 

**Genomics and Computational Biology** 

**Cancer** 

**Phylogenetics**

**Electronic Health Records and Epidemiology**
